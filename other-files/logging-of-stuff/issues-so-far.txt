problems with website currently

Things I need to consider:
- Different browsers
- Device type
- Device screen-size
- Device pixel density
- Layouts of website for different Device Types


Whole website
	Problem:
		Responsive design isn't working properly, I need to do some more research
	What I want to happen:
		- Mobile:
			Responsive design Key things:
			- Sizing determined by the preset screen and text sizing
			 (does not change during viewing of website because sizing
			  isn't something that happens on mobile)
			- No resizing of website (only mobile version of website is displayed
			  unless requested by user (but this should not be defaulted)
			- All of the animation of boxes should be smoother upon rotation of screen
		- Desktop:
			Responsive design key things:
			- Smooth transition of objects when windows is resized
			- Website is designed properly so that all features are displayed as intended
			- No snapping of features when there is an animation (something moving or changing property)
- ftr-socialmedia-icons
	Problem:
		Responsive design when shinking makes the icons not porpotionally sized (Not circular, they turn into ovals)
	What I want to happen:
		I want the size of the social media icons to remain constant (ish)
		I also want to the social media icons to wrap to the next line when they can't fit the window
		I also want the margins of the social media box to not exist/shrink down to 0 (ish) when in small window

- ftr-box
	Problem:
		Responsive design screws up the text wrapping and it just overflows.
	What I want to happen:
		I want the text to stay in the damn box it is in and for the box to move
		Height should be the expansive value, when it hits a certain height.

-hdr
	Problem:
		I need to setup the media queries properly
	What I want to happen:
		Smooth transition between resizing of the website

-scrollbar
	Problem:
		Window resizing causes horizontal scrollbar to appear
	What I want to happen:
		I only want a vertical scrollbar at all times
