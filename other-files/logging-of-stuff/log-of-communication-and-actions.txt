Philips Website Start Date 1/7/2021

==== Day 0 (1/7/2021) ====
Philip called me today (1/7/2021) in the evening to figure out if I can do a website for him
I said, yes, but I would need to do a little research about "website things" as I haven't done anything in a while with building websites and I could use some brushing up on material. (Code, Hosting Services, Techniques, Pricing, maybe some other things)

I also briefly said to Philip that my pricing would be around 15 dollars an hour because this job is not labor intensive.
I also told philip that I do not count "Researching" stuff as part of my pay, so I will be excluding all of my hours involving research.
Things I will not be paid for:
- Researching
- Logging of actions and communication

Pay from hours I will be including:
- Actually building website
- Working with Philip to build website


Talked to mom about pricing, how much she paid for her website (later that evening, during out grocery shopping trip)
She mentioned the pricing that her website developer and her agreed upon was $1,100
This accounts for 1 page and a shop.
I would say the shop accounts for 4 pages
1,100 / 5 (pages) = 220 per page

I intend to be paid hourly (as there might be some extra long circumstances)
Then I will determine if the pricing of the page is too high or too low with reference of my effort towards it (in time spent).
We will adjust the pricing after I have done everything to be as fair as possible.

It should take about 14.6 hours to complete one page (according to the estimate my mom gave me)

==== Day 1 (1/8/2021) ====

Started researching material (Hosting Services, and some other things) 2:00pm

Went to pages.github.com and made a website
keegangrajek.github.io
The repository for editing the files is github.come/keegangrajek/keegangrajek.github.io
I am now looking at the documentation for github pages

I need to figure out:
- How to change the DNS (Domain Name System) of the website to a custom domain.
- How to include other website files that are more advanced (jquery, php, javascript, etc)

Philip called me at 5:30pm to 5:55pm and we talked about a few things logged in call-notes/call-1-day-1

==== Day 2 (1/9/2021) ====

Started figuring out domain name connection to the website.

Did some more research on how to use the github website

==== Day 3 (1/10/2021) ====

Purchased website domain name

I payed 27 dollars for both domains aamericanconstruction.com and a-americanconstruction.com as well as 1 user account to manage the domain.

Then I configured the doman services to meet the needs of the website (security, proper linking)

I need to talk to philip about the pricing of keeping the doman should be $2.50 a month

==== Day 4 (1/14/2021) ====
Hours spent working (2 hours)

Linked domain to website (started at 12:00am stopped at 1:30am) (continued at 3:30am till 4:00am)

Paused because when I initialized the dns process through google and github's servers, there is a 48 hour wait time to get everything configured properly on their end.

I verified that everything was working properly using the commands:
dig www.a-americanconstruction.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
dig www.aamericanconstruction.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
and I tested the website's backend operation by going to the url on google chrome. Both www.aamericanconstruction.com www.a-americanconstruction.com and a-americanconstruction.com

I will check the box for "force https" after the ssl certificate has processes through github's system. But for now I will work on something else...

==== Day 5 (1/15/2021) ====
Hours spent working (1 hour)

Started coding a few essential things for the base website framework
- Footer of website
- Header of website

Will make plan for other pages and confirm with Philip about the choices he might want to do.

==== Day 6 (1/16/2021) ====
Hours spent working (3 hours)

Continued coding the base website framework
- Footer of website
- Header of website

==== Day 7 (1/18/2021) ====

Just did a ton of research on what key elements need to go into the footer, and I have made a list of them and am going to edit the list down to essential things.

Took a long break to make enough money for my flight to Colorado

==== Day 8 (1/25/2021) ====

Started at 4:00pm stopped at 5:00pm

Started working on the website again. Going to continue working on the footer and header as needed.

worked on the footer links to the important legal documents that maintain the website's credibility and legality.

==== Day 11 (3/5/2021) ====

called philip around 4:00pm to talk about some things
this call was really short I will not count any time for it

==== Day 12 (3/7/2021) ====

Started at 8:00pm stopped at 9:45pm

working on editing the footer because a lot of the things on it need to be optimized and the animations need to work better with the styling

I made all the copyright changes to the code files I am currently working on so there are no legal issues with ownership

Now I am going to design a universal button to be used throughout the website

==== Day 13 (3/12/2021) ====

Started at 10:00pm stopped at 11:30pm

Finally figured out everything with the dummy website, and now have it running everything on my local ip.

I will link it up to a free DNS hosting service to allow philip to view the website externally as the ip is already port forwarded.

I am going to also transfer over all of the css and make sure my organization format for the html elements work properly as to continue to use it
in the future.
